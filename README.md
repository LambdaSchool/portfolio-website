Dear Hiring Manager,
It gives me great pleasure to apply as Full Stack Developer. Design in chaos has been my life’s most interesting revelation. I would love to help your company in their many activities.
I am MD from India. While doing MHSA at Creighton, HR was my master’s concentration. Also, at our home business, Omega Health Partners, I was involved in recruiting and training of working partners. I was also involved in the designing of working website and connecting it to Square and IntakeQ.
As a student of Lambda, I have had the opportunity to work as Full Stack Web Developer and have got trained with keen eye for attention to detail. As a Team Lead at Lambda, it is my job to be empathetic and compassionate leader, with an eye on the top talent.
I am located in Omaha and I do not wish to relocate.
I hope you consider my application.
It would be an honor to work for your company.
Sincerely,
Shruti Malik
