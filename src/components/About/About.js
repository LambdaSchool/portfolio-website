        I started working with HTML, CSS, and PHP in 2008 during the summer of my sophomore year. I taught my webmastering class the following two years, made a website, and never did anything with it. Shortly after, I joined the army, went to South Korea, and realized that computer languages aren't the only type that I'm good at learning.

        I decided to go to college to pursue this new world of interests, just to find that the school that I was accepted to made the executive decision to drop all of the non-basic language classes that I was wishing to pursue.
