				<h2>The Past</h2>
				<p>My original creative outlet has always been music. When I was 12 years old, we moved away from the little beach town I grew up in, Copalis Beach WA. We moved into a city called Aberdeen WA. It is there I found my love for music. I found new friends who were into music, and started singing and playing guitar. I started a band with a few friends called Ninthhour, and I spent the next 5 years creating and performing music with them. By the time I turned 18 years old, we all wanted to go in different directions musically, so we decide to go our seperate ways. After that I heard through some friends that a band called Painted Soul was looking for a vocalist. I decided to try out, and it was a perfect fit. I spent the next 7 years creating, recording, performing, and touring the west coast and eastern parts of Washington with Painted Soul. Those were some of the best times of my life. All good things must come to an end though, family life for us all needed more attention then we could give it having fulltime jobs, families and the band. Something had to give and Painted Soul was that something. </p>

				<h2>The Present</h2>
					<p>In 2013 I became the luckiest man in the world, I asked the woman I love and cherish more than anything in the world to marry me and she accepted. We moved into a house and started to build our lives together. I worked as a Telecom Technician and she as a supervisor for an Aerospace company. I had been growing dissatisfied in my work and wanted to find something where I could use my creativity. I started looking into coding camps with a friend of mine. My wife and I were in the process of trying to figure out how to make a coding school work on 1 income, when everything changed.  In 2017 we recieved wonderful news that we were becoming parents. Since we didn't make enough money to afford child care, and we had no family that could assist in that department, my wife and I decided that she would stay home and take care of our son. Which meant we had to find a way to make enough to cover what we lost not having her income and rebudget to support our new baby boy. I was blessed enough to find a role within a company where I could achieve that. I work for a contractor to a major telecom company, we ensure all construction projects are "Self-install" ready. Customers would be able to install their devices on there own if they choose. I also work to redesign and rewire existing properties that have become inadequate with the most recent advances in technology. I felt I was destined to stay in telecom construction forever. Then one day a developer friend of mine (the one I was shopping around coding schools with in fact) told me about <a id="lambda" href="https://lambdaschool.com/">Lambda School.</a> I read about their unique way of tackling the tuition challenges of students, as well as offering a part time course, as I would need to continue my full time job, this would be key. So I applied, was interviewed over the phone, and happily informed I had been accept to the Feb. 25th 2019 cohort. Now I spend my days working, being a father, and coding away. At first it all seemed pretty daunting, even to this day the massive amount of information can be overwhelming but I've really come to enjoy the process of figuring out the solution. Then getting to watch it change beofre your eyes is exciting and fun. I love learning how things work, and be able to bring complex ideas to life.  </p>

				<h2>The Future</h2>
				<p>Everyday is something new, a new hurdle, and a new breakthrough. I look forward to the challenges ahead of me. I'm excited to dig into backend languages and concepts, and to be able to expand what i can create.</p>
