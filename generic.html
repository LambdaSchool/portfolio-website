							<h1 class="major">Automation Improves Workflow</h1>
							<p>I enjoy writing scripts that do the heavy lifting for me so I can focus on finer details.</p>
							<a href="images/raidConsumesSpreadsheet.png"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/raidConsumesSpreadsheet.png" alt="" /></span></a>
							<p>I created the above spreadsheet to reduce time wasted taking inventory in a game I play. It utilizes a macro I wrote that automatically 
								populates a spreadsheet of all the items in your inventory that can be easily searched and referenced for this home page.</p>
							<a href="images/censusFormatterHome.png"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/censusFormatterHome.png" alt="" /></span></a>
							<p>Above is a spreadsheet I created to speed up my workflow at my job as an account manager. It reduced the time it took me to run insurance
								quotes from all morning and most of an afternoon, to about 15-30 minutes.
							</p>
							<p> I retrieved health insurance quotes from several
								insurance carriers for small business accounts assigned to me by the account managers. Each carrier allowed you to upload a company's census
								as an excel spreadsheet, but each carrier had a different format of spreadsheet. The spreadsheet I created allows you to input the census
								into the first page, and populates the other pages that have specialized formats for each carrier. The alternative to using this spreadsheet
								is to either manually enter each employee and their information into each carrier's formatted census spreadsheet, or manually enter each
								employee and their information into the carrier website. 
							</p>
							<p>The other catch is that you cannot upload a single page of this spreadsheet to the carrier. To address this, I created a VBA macro that
								automatically creates an uploadable excel file for each carrier. You can just choose which carriers you want to run quotes for using the 
								list on the right, and then click "Create Sheets" to automatically create the uploadable census spreadsheets for each carrier.
