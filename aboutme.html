				<section> Hello world. My name is Nick Perez . After taking a short hiatus from the tech scene I have come back to fulfill my career goal as a Full stack Web Developer.</section>
			
				<p>
				   Prior to my long needed break , I spent several years programming and building up my skills by attending programs schools , doing contract/freelance jobs, and by participating in various hackathons. Several years back I attented the original "Dev Bootcamp" where I completed a 19-week fulltime course learning  code and building various apps. Following that I had a several contract positions at some small to midsize startups including OrderAhead and Happy Inspector  . In between and during these contract roles I also participated in many hackathons having won several of them - the biggest of which was Docusign's Momentum Hackathon.  Just recently I completed a year long immersive program where I took in depth courses in full stack web development using Javascript and its related frameworks </p>
				<!-- <p> 	A little more about myself. I was born and raised here in the Bay Area. I attended Junipero Serra in San Mateo for high school , then later attended the University of San Francisco for college. It was there where I majored in International Business and minored in Chinese studies.  Part of major's requirements was learning Mandarin . This was by far the hardest thing I had ever done, but it was well worth it. The skills I developed learning foreign languages have found themselves usefull as I continue learning new programmming languages. </p> -->
