				<p> Greetings world. My name is Nick Perez and I am a Full stack Web Developer.</p>
				<p>  The ability to create something meaningful from mere words on a screen  fascinates me and is why I see myself enjoying this career path well into the future  </p>
				<p>
				 I have been able to hone my skills as a developer by attending several programs , doing contract and freelance jobs, and by participating in various coding competions. Several years back I attented the original "Dev Bootcamp" where I completed a 19-week fulltime course spending  10 - 16 hrs a day learning various programming languages and building various apps. Following that I had a several contract positions at some small startups including OrderAhead and Piccme . In between and during these contract positions I also participated in many hackathons having won several of them - the biggest of which was Docusign's Momentum Hackathon.</p>
				<!-- <p> 	A little more about myself. I was born and raised here in the Bay Area. I attended Junipero Serra in San Mateo for high school , then later attended the University of San Francisco for college. It was there where I majored in International Business and minored in Chinese studies.  Part of major's requirements was learning Mandarin . This was by far the hardest thing I had ever done, but it was well worth it. The skills I developed learning foreign languages have found themselves usefull as I continue learning new programmming languages. </p> -->
