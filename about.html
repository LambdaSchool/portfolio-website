									<h3 class="major">About Me</h3>
									<h4>Summary:</h4>
									<p>I am a artist first and foremost, I love to draw, paint, sketch, color, pretty much anything that allows me to get some creative work onto paper or canvas. That being said, my canvas most recently has become the web. Being an artist, but also a very strategic and analytical thinker, I realized I needed a way to express myself in a way that I could not only display my art for the world to see but also to help others, and make a decent living. Once I discovered web development I instantly fell in love, it was a way for me to show my creativity in a modern 21st century way.</p>

									<h4>Long Version:</h4>
									<p>With all that being said I can honestly say my first experience with code although brief and I vaguely remember any of it was when I was 16, there where a group of kids that would hangout with my best friend and they had "free" games like minecraft with extra mods that weren't available in the normal game, that they would sell them for like $5. One day I asked how they got the games, and why they where different, and it was then that I learned about Java. Flash forward a few months and I am taking my first computer class, since I only lack 3 credits to graduate, I spend half the day in a trade program that teaches the architecture of engineering a computer down to designing the circuit boards and writing the binary. It was in this class that i learned about C and C++. Flash forwards, 6 years...I'm 22 life has almost killed all my dreams, I decide to become a machinist and go to a trade school, and for the first time in 6 years...I get a taste of writing code, though it's procedural and very low level. I learn G & M Code to be a CNC Machinist, after working in the field I realize there is no writing code and I decide to pursue a CS Degree because of my desire to work with computers and write code, and the fact that I still had random app ideas, I just have no idea where to begin or what to even learn...not wanting to commit to something I may not enjoy, I find a accredited tuition-free online university, and decide to take a Computer Science major. 1 year later, I have used at least 12 different programming languages for different classes, and finally now that I couldn't get past roadblocks when trying to teach myself React, I decided to join Lambda School so I could build my portfolio and become a full-stack web developer .</p>

									<h3 class="major">My Favorite Projects</h3>
									<p>Here are two of my favorite projects that i've done. Although, they aren't the most technically advanced. They are projects that where very fun to work on.</p>

									<section class="features">
										<article>
<!--											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a>-->
											<h3 class="major">Techne</h3>
											<p>An App I've been working on that will allow artists to share there work with each other and collaborate together. On this project I made the designs, and mockups using Figma. This project, is something I'm doing in my free time whenever I have the opportunity to work on it.</p>
